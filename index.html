  <h1>Penguins</h1>
  <p>Penguins are cool and fascinating birds. Read on to learn more.</p>

  <h2>Overview about Penguins</h2>
  <p>Penguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the Southern
    Hemisphere. Only one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives at, and slightly north of, the equator. Highly adapted
    for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most
    penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole
    while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.[4]</p>

  <h2>Different Breeds of Penguins</h2>

  <h3>Northern Rockhopper</h3>
  <p>The northern rockhopper penguin (Eudyptes moseleyi), Moseley's rockhopper penguin, or Moseley's penguin, is a
    penguin species or subspecies native to the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans. It is described as distinct from
    the southern rockhopper penguin.</p>
  <p>
    A study published in 2009 showed that the population of the northern rockhopper had declined by 90% since the 1950s.
    For this reason, the northern rockhopper penguin is classified as endangered.</p>

  <h3>Emperor</h3>
  <p>The emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri) is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic
    to Antarctica. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 100 cm (39 in) in length and weighing
    from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). Feathers of the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly,
    pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches.</p>
  <p>
    Like all species of penguin, the emperor is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened
    into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as
    krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, the species can remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to
    a depth of 535 m (1,755 ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured
    haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to
    reduce its metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.

  <p>
    The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek 50–120 km (31–75 mi) over
    the ice to breeding colonies which can contain up to several thousand individuals. The female lays a single egg,
    which is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents
    subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The lifespan of an emperor penguin
    is typically 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live as long as 50 years
    of age.
